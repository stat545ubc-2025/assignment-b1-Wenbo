# AssignmentB1

This repository contains the work for **AssignmentB1** of UBC STAT 545B course.
In this assignment, I created a function and demonstrated two examples of using it, as well as successfully completing three tests.

## Repository Overview 

The repository includes 1 folder and 3 files:
-   `Assignment1_files/figure-gfm` （A folder containing all the plots for this Assignment）
-  `README.md` (Describes what the repository has)
-  `Assignment1.Rmd` (Original R Markdown document for the assignment)
-  `Assignment1.md` (Corresponding knitted .md outputs)


## How to engage with the repository

- Option 1: Directly open the `Assignment1.md` file on Github to see the answer to the assignment.
- Option 2: Download the whole folder and open the `rmd` files in RStudio, then install the required packages and knit it to see the outputs.
